## Project Overview
Global Superstore is a global online retailer based in New York, boasting a broad product catalogue and aiming to be a one-stop-shop for its customers. Global Superstore’s
clientele, hailing from 147 different countries, can browse through an endless offering with more than 10,000 products. 

This large selection comprises three main categories: office supplies (e.g., staples), furniture (e.g., chairs), and technology (e.g., smartphones).
I'm contracted as a Data Analyst to help Global Superstore analyze and draw outmeaningful insight from the Superstore dataset, which would aid management in making informed decisions to improve performance and profitability. 

### Project Objectives
As a data analyst I was tasked with the following
### KPIs
- Total Sales 
- Total Profit 
- Average Discount  
- Total Orders 

### Business Requirement
- Question 1
   - What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014?
   - For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit. Specifically, what are the products’ names and the total profit for each product? 
- Question 2
   - Identify the 3 subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in the United States. 
- Question 3
   - Which city is the least profitable (in terms of average profit) in the United States? For this analysis, discard the cities with less than 10 Orders. 
   - Why is this city’s average profit so low?
- Question 4
   - Which product subcategory has the highest average profit in Australia?
- Question 5
   - Assess Nigeria’s profitability (Total Profit) for 2014. How does it compare to other African countries? 
   - What factors might be responsible for Nigeria’s poor performance? You might want to investigate shipping costs and the average discount as potential root causes.

![Nigeria Profitability](https://github.com/Chisom83/Global_SuperStore/blob/main/Image%202/Screenshot%202025-05-09%20094524.png?raw=true) 

- Insight:
   - Across 45 African countries that patronize the store, Nigeria has the highest customers and order volume but lowest profit.
   - In order of ranking in total Sales Nigeria ranked the fifth and the least in total profit showing that they are making sales but generating no profit at all.
   - High discount rates is the primary factors leading to low profit.
   - Discounts are applied to every product ordered, which significantly reduces profit margins.
   - shipping costs in Nigeria are relatively moderate, and not a contributing factor to the poor profit performance.

- Measures Used:[Africa Total Sales](Dax_Measures.md#africa-total-sales), [African Total Profit](Dax_Measures.md#africa-total-profit), [Africa Average Discount](Dax_Measures.md#africa-average-discount), [Africa Total Quantity](Dax_Measures.md#africa-total-quantity), [Africa Total Orders](Dax_Measures.md#africa-total-orders), [Africa Total Shipping Cost](Dax_Measures.md#africa-total-shipping-cost), [Africa Total Customer](Dax_Measures.md#africa-total-customer) and the country column.
  
### Recommendations
- Temporarily Eliminate Discounts:
   - Remove all product discounts for a three-month trial period, monitor the effect on sales, customer retention, and profit. This will help evaluate whether discounts are essential for maintaining customer activity.

- Adjust Discount Strategy if Necessary:
   - If removing discounts results in a significant drop in customer engagement, reintroduce discounts only on bulk purchases ( e.g.,5 items and above) and ensure that discount rates remain below the average discount rate of the store.
   - Alternatively, offer non-monetary incentives such as free gifts for purchases of five or more different items.
   
### Conclusion

Discounting is a key driver of low profitability despite strong sales. Top-performing markets (e.g., United State, South African in the African region) had minimal or no discounts. Strategic reduction in discounts can significantly improve profit without sacrificing sales volume.
